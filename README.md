# BCF Web Integration

This project is a web-based tool for visualizing IFC files and managing BCF (BIM Collaboration Format) issues. It includes a RESTful API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting BCF Topics and Comments, and uses That Openâ€™s AECOsystem libraries to handle IFC and BCF data in the browser.
